# Socioeconomic Factors affecting Healthcare in America
Team Project that examines and illustrates how socioeconomic factors affect patient outcomes in America. 

## Introduction

Quality of care and patient outcomes are significant determinants of the effectiveness of a healthcare system. My teamâ€™s project expands upon the best practices in healthcare analytics for evaluating the current status of patient care, and analyzes relationships between various factors that drive cost and influence high quality outcomes. Our project summarizes the findings in a comprehensive, interactive representation of these factors to provide enhanced insight into the main drivers of quality of healthcare, and ultimately facilitates improved patient control and targeted improvement efforts.

## Getting Started

Select your destination folder for the patient socioeconomic and outcome table. Both the R and Python scripts are set to run with relative paths, so placing both of these files into the same destination folder is enough (no need to set a working directory).
